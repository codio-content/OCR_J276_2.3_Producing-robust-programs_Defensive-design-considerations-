Authentication is the process of determining whether someone trying to log into the network is who they declare to be and the primary method of authentication is by the use of login names and passwords.

Authentication routines should be included in programs so that a userâ€™s login name and password can be compared with those stored in the system. They can be stored in data structures such as arrays which could be permanently stored in text files.

There is an example of an authentication routine for you to complete in the questions at the end of this lesson.
